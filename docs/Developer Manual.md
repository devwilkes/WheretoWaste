3. Ensure that the project's dependencies are all installed (see above section for details).

## How to run WheretoWaste in a server
To run this project within a server, you'll need to hook up the dependencies of the GitHub repository within Vercel.

Simply clone this repository into your own GitHub account, and hook it up to a new Vercel deployment.

## WheretoWaste Server APIs

WheretoWaste is entirely built using three open-source APIs.
* [IP Stack](https://ipstack.com/)
* [Wikipedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:API)
* [Trash Nothing](Trash Nothing https://trashnothing.com/app/developer?_z=web-2025-05-15T18%3A14%3A34&_display_mode=browser)

## Known Bugs and Errors
* Currently, the SupaBase database is not responding properly to fetch/get requests despite being established and connected in the backend.
* Universal styling is bugged for the indentation of the Search and About pages.

## Future Developments
* Although WheretoWaste is currently deployed for most PC operating systems, developing mobile-friendly versions of this application would be a promising next route to go. Further down the line with this, developing WheretoWaste's functionality into a mobile application would be a great way to establish more user outreach and offer a higher level of convenience to users.
