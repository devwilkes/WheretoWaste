# WheretoWaste: A waste disposal search solution
## Created by Devon Wilkes

# What is WhereToWaste?
WheretoWaste is a search platform/engine that allows users to input a trash item that they need to dispose of, and receive relevant information about proper disposal solutions, as well as local trash removal/recycling resources that they can use for said solutions. The goal is to not only inform users about proper waste disposal procedures, but to educate them about sustainability and safety through recommended disposal solutions.

# How can WheretoWaste help users?
Although trash disposal seems like a relatively easy task to do for the average consumer, there are several categories of objects that are either too difficult to dispose of through normal means (bulky items, yard waste, furniture, etc.), or are highly advised against or illegal to dispose of through the trash (explosive/flammable materials, chemical products, electronics, etc.). 

Consumers may not be educated on how to properly dispose of these items or may not be informed of services/resources available in their area to trash them. Not knowing how to dispose of such objects may leave them prone to getting fined for improper disposal by their local government, putting themselves and others at risk of injury due to improper disposal of hazardous materials, or begin to accumulate unnecessary junk in their properties after giving up on finding ways to discard them.

By educating and informing users of my website on how/where to dispose of otherwise difficult-to-dispose-of objects, they can alleviate the risk of fines/injury/junk accumulation via improper disposal by adopting acceptable and sustainable trash removal habits.

# What is WheretoWaste's Target Audience(s)?
WheretoWaste is designed to be accessible by web browser users (Edge, Chrome, Firefox, etc.), but can also be accessible to mobile browser users on iOS devices. Later down the line, I do want to try implementing WheretoWaste as a mobile application using Swift.
